# 🧩 Web3 Startup Project Management

## 1. Project Scope Summary

### ✅ In Scope
- Development of a responsive and modern landing page to introduce the client’s Web3 platform.  
- MetaMask wallet integration that allows users to connect and claim an airdrop token.  
- Presentation of token details and community benefits through interactive UI components.  
- Inclusion of announcement and social media channels for engagement.  
- Deployment to a custom domain with SSL security and analytics tracking.

### 🚫 Out of Scope
- Blockchain smart contract creation or token deployment (assumed provided by client).  
- Post-launch content management or marketing automation.  
- Mobile app or Web3 dApp expansion beyond the landing page.

### 💡 Assumptions
- The client provides the brand identity kit, content, and smart contract APIs.  
- Hosting and domain access will be available before Week 9.  
- Testing will be performed on both desktop and mobile viewports.  
- The project team has experience with Next.js, Tailwind, and Ethers.js integration.

### ⚙️ Constraints
- 10-week development timeline with weekly progress reviews.  
- Limited blockchain engineer availability (estimated 20% allocation).  
- Time-bound milestones; design approval delays will affect downstream tasks.

## 4. Clarification Questions for Client

1. Which blockchain network (Ethereum, Polygon, or BNB) will be used for wallet connection and token transactions?  
2. Will you provide the token contract address, ABI, and test wallet addresses for development and simulation?  
3. Is the token claim feature intended to be an actual on-chain airdrop or a simulated environment for MVP testing?  
4. Should we integrate wallet connection exclusively for MetaMask, or include other wallets such as WalletConnect or Coinbase Wallet?  
5. Do you have existing brand guidelines—logos, color palette, and fonts—that should be followed for the landing page design?  
6. Would you like analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics or Plausible) integrated to monitor user engagement and traffic?  
7. What is your preferred hosting platform for deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or AWS)?  
8. Are there specific security standards or compliance requirements we need to follow for wallet connections and data handling?  
9. Who will serve as the main point of contact for milestone approvals and client feedback?  
10. How will you define a “successful” launch for this MVP—specific performance metrics, user engagement, or on-time delivery?

## 5. Internal Kickoff Email (To Team)

**Subject:** Kickoff Meeting – Web3 Landing Page Project (10-Week Plan)

Hi Team,  

We’ve been assigned to build a Web3 landing page that allows users to connect their wallets and claim tokens. This is a 10-week project with design, development, and blockchain integration phases.  

Please review the attached project brief before our internal kickoff session.  

**Focus points for our discussion:**
- Frontend–backend synchronization strategy  
- Wallet integration workflow  
- Risk and dependency log  

Let’s align our tools early — **Figma** for design, **Notion** for progress tracking, and **GitHub** for commits.  

Best,  
**Mikko De Torres**  
Project Manager

## 6. Client Clarification Email

**Subject:** Clarifications Before Design Phase – Web3 Landing Page Project  

Hi [Client Name],  

I hope you’re doing well. Before we proceed with the design and wallet integration phases, I’d like to confirm a few details to align the team’s efforts accurately:  

- Which blockchain network will the wallet connect to (Ethereum, Polygon, or BNB)?  
- Are your smart contract endpoints and APIs ready for integration testing by Week 4?  
- May we request access to brand assets (logos, colors, fonts, and copy guidelines)?  

Your input will help us finalize the implementation sequence and avoid mid-project delays.  

Warm regards,  
**Mikko De Torres**  
Project Manager
